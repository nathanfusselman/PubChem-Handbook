CSE 3310 - Fundamentals of Software Engineering

#### Overview:
This was a group project where we demonstrated our abilities to design and build an advances piece of software such as the android applications found here. This project focuses on our ability to use the agile process to pre-plan our development and architecture with detailed models of our app.

This app allows for you to search and save data from the PubChem database on your device well as keep up on all news in the area of chemistry.

#### Key Features:
* Search [PubChems](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database by keyword or chemical makeup for compounds
* Search [PubChems](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) database using the periodic table for input
* View specific information such as safety information and structural diagrams of compounds
* Download and share compound information
* Add notes to compounds for future reference
* Save compounds to list for quicker reference
  * Recent history is saved by default in a list for the user to reference
* View specific elements and their attributes on the periodic table graphically
* Change periodic table color scheme to graphically show element attributes
* View recent news from a Science Daily RSS Feed
